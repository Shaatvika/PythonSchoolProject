# PythonSchoolProject

# ABSTRACT

In the present COVID era, many workers have lost their jobs and returned to their hometowns. To combat this problem, our group has come up with a project which helps immigrants secure a job and a sustainable livelihood. With its interactive interface, our platform enables users to view the jobs available with the help of their given skill set, age background and other factors.

# INTRO

The objective is to make the process of immigration easier. With our application, we help eliminate all possible uncertainties about jobs available, recommend users possible cities to reside, and provide possible figures of salary in the particular region. To make this possible, we plan to gather information about the labourersâ€™ age, education and skills and integrate these with the statistical findings. This way, the best options would be recommended and therefore, a wise and informed decision can be made by the user.


# FLOW

Our project integrates 2 programming languages- namely MySQL and Python. MySQL serves as the storehouse of our statistical data. Once we receive the input, with the help of Python and MySQL commands, we call this data. After checking all the parameters, we make a concise decision by calling the necessary functions. Next, we upload the users data in a CSV file and we print the information as asked by the user. 


# GROUP MEMBERS

We, Neha Namburi, S Sri Shaatvika and Vikhyat Sai Jagini, are a group of 3 from The Amaatra Academy who are looking forward to using our knowledge and skills to make the world a better place.
